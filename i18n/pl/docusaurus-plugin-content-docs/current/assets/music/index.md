This is the default and recommended driver for new projects. When using this driver you will need to create `.uge` music files and you will have the ability to edit your music files within GB Studio using the _Music Editor_.

See the documentation for using [hUGE Driver](/docs/assets/music/music-huge) for more information.

### GBT Player

This is the driver used for GB Studio 2 and below. When using this driver you will need to create `.mod` music files using external Tracker software.
